# Citi Bike Exploration Problem

# Company Overview:
Citi Bike is a leading bike-sharing program that offers a flexible and reliable rental service in New York City, providing a convenient and eco-friendly transportation option for residents and visitors. Citi Bank first published itâ€™s data for public in 2013, facilitating analysis, development, visualisation and other applications. The data for this project can be accessed through the following URL: [Citi Bike NYC System Data](https://citibikenyc.com/system-data) and [Data Repository](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html).

The data repository contains detailed trip data, including information on bike usage, station locations, and temporal patterns. For our analysis, we will use the data from May 2024, as it provides the most recent information on crucial trends and patterns. 

# Project Overview: 
 In this problem, we are tasked with analysing data from Citi Bike rental company to provide insights and recommendations that will optimise their operations. The company aims to better understand how bikes should be distributed among various stations and determine the optimal stock levels required to meet demand efficiently.
 
The primary goal of this analysis is to:
1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the available data, identify patterns, and derive insights related to bike usage.
2. Predictive Modelling: Develop machine learning model Random Forest Regressor to predict bike demand at different stations and times.
3. Optimisation: Propose strategies to optimise the distribution of bikes across stations and manage stock levels using LinProg, ensuring that supply meets demand efficiently.
4. Recommendations: Provide actionable insights and recommendations that the company can implement to improve their operational efficiency and enhance user satisfaction.
